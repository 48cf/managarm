> This part of the handbook is Work-In-Progress.

libasync is a core part of the Managarm operating system. libasync uses the power of coroutines introduced in C++20 to provide async operations. Managarm, being an async operating system, makes extensive use of the functionality provided by libasync.

The code for libasync can be found at [https://github.com/managarm/libasync](https://github.com/managarm/libasync).
